Currently in development and testing.  
  
### Features
- **High-quality music** (with support for multiple sources such as YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud and more)
- **Slash commands** (easy to use and modern - we even recently implemented autocomplete!)
- **Free forever** (no vote-locked commands, no paywalls)
- **Reliable** (basically no downtime after release)
- **Actively developed** (new features are added regularly and your feedback is greatly appreciated)
- More features coming soon
